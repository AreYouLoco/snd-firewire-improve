== General ==

This repository is a test for my patch candidates for ALSA firewire stack.
You can install my snd-firewire-lib, snd-fireworks, snd-bebob and snd-oxfw by DKMS.


== snd-firewire-lib, snd-bebob, snd-fireworks, snd-dice and snd-oxfw ==

They are device drivers utilize Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) and Linux
Firewire Subsystem (so called "juju").
 - snd-bebob: for devices based on BridgeCo's chipset and BeBoB firmware
 - snd-fireworks: for devices based on Echo Audio's Fireworks module
 - snd-dice: for devices based on TC Applied Technologies DICE chipset family
 - snd-oxfw: for devices based on Oxford Semiconductor OXFW970/971 chipset
 - snd-firewire-lib: for helper functions of AMDTP/CMP/FCP and AV/C commands

There is a project in user land, "FFADO".
http://www.ffado.org/

My aim is implementing streaming functionality in ALSA, in kernel land.

I test these drivers with:
 - snd-bebob: Yamaha GO44, GO46
 - snd-bebob: M-Audio Ozonic, Firewire Solo, Firewire Audiophile, Firewire 410,
 - snd-bebob: Firewire 1814
 - snd-fireworks: AudioFirePre8, AudioFire4
 - snd-dice: TC Electronic Impact Twin
 - snd-oxfw: Behringer F-Control 202
 - snd-oxfw: Griffin FireWave

Some dedicated testers test these drivers with:
 - snd-bebob: Edirol FA-66 (great thanks to Fryderyk Dziarmagowski)
 - snd-bebob: Edirol FA_66 (great thanks to Daniel Wagner)
 - snd-bebob: BridgeCo Audio A5 (great thanks to Daniel Wagner)
 - snd-bebob: PreSonus FP10 (great thanks to David Henningsson)
 - snd-bebob: M-Audio ProjectMix I/O (great thanks to Darren Anderson)
 - snd-bebob: Terratec PHASE X24 FW (great thanks to Maximilian Engelhardt)


== Requirement ==

- Linux kernel 3.11 or later


== Current status ==

 - Capture/playback of PCM/MIDI is supported at any sampling rate, any clock source
 - HWDEP interface is supported for mixer control application

== Easy instraction with DKMS ==

DKMS - Dynamic Kernel Module Support is easy for installing or updating external modules.
http://linux.dell.com/dkms/

This instruction is for Debian/Ubuntu. You need to make your arrangement for
the other Linux distribution if you use.

Then you need to install 'dkms' package.
 $ sudo apt-get install dkms

Then you need to install 'linux-headers' package to make drivers for your kernel.
 $ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic

Install:
1. $ git clone https://github.com/takaswie/snd-firewire-improve.git
2. $ ln -s $(pwd)/snd-firewire-improve/ /usr/src/alsa-firewire-3.11
(superuser)
3. $ dkms install alsa-firewire/3.11 (superuser)

Uninstall
1. $ modprobe -r snd-bebob snd-fireworks snd-dice snd-oxfw snd-firewire-lib (superuser)
2. $ dkms remove alsa-firewire/3.11 --all (superuser)
3. $ rm /usr/src/alsa-firewire-3.11 (superuser)
4. $ rm snd-firewire-improve

== Bug repots  ==

Linux 3.16 or later already includes snd-bebob and snd-fireworks, thus any bug reports
should be sent to alsa-devel.

http://mailman.alsa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/alsa-devel

I add proc interface to help debug. Please send the output to me with your
experience.

snd-bebob:
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#firmware
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#formation
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#clock
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#meter (if the device has)

snd-fireworks:
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#firmware
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#clock
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#meters

snd-dice:
 - /proc/asound/cardX/dice

snd-oxfw:
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#formation
