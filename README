== General ==

This repository is a test for my patch candidates for ALSA firewire stack.
You can install my snd-firewire-lib, snd-fireworks, snd-bebob and snd-oxfw by DKMS.


== snd-firewire-lib, snd-bebob, snd-fireworks and snd-oxfw ==

These are device drivers utilize Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) and Linux
Firewire Subsystem (so called "juju").
 - snd-bebob: for devices based on BridgeCo's chipset and BeBoB firmware
 - snd-fireworks: for devices based on Echo Audio's Fireworks module
 - snd-oxfw: for devices based on Oxford Semiconductor OXFW970/971 chipset
 - snd-firewire-lib: for helper functions of AMDTP/CMP/FCP and AV/C commands

There is a project in user land, "FFADO".
http://www.ffado.org/

My aim is implementing streaming functionality in ALSA, in kernel land.

I test these drivers with:
 - snd-bebob: Yamaha GO44, GO46
 - snd-bebob: M-Audio Ozonic, Firewire Solo, Firewire Audiophile, Firewire 410,
 - snd-bebob: Firewire 1814
 - snd-fireworks: Echo AudioFire12, AudioFirePre8, AudioFire4
 - snd-oxfw: Behringer F-Control 202

My testers test these drivers with:
 - snd-bebob: Edirol FA-66 (great thanks to Fryderyk Dziarmagowski)
 - snd-bebob: Edirol FA_66 (great thanks to Daniel Wagner)
 - snd-bebob: BridgeCo AUdio A5 (great thanks to Daniel Wagner)
 - snd-bebob: PreSonus FP10 (great thanks to David Henningsson)

== Requirement ==

- Linux kernel 3.11 or later


== Current status ==

 - Capture/playback of PCM/MIDI is supported at any sampling rate, any clock source
 - HWDEP interface is supported for mixer control application


== Easy instraction with DKMS ==

DKMS - Dynamic Kernel Module Support is easy for installing or updating external modules.
http://linux.dell.com/dkms/

This instruction is for Debian/Ubuntu. You need to make your arrangement for
the other Linux distribution if you use.

Then you need to install 'dkms' package.
 $ sudo apt-get install dkms

Then you need to install 'linux-headers' package to make drivers for your kernel.
 $ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic

Install:
1. $ git clone https://github.com/takaswie/snd-firewire-improve.git
2. $ ln -s $(pwd)/snd-firewire-improve/ /usr/src/snd-firewire-3.11
(superuser)
3. $ dkms install snd-firewire/3.11 (superuser)

Uninstall
1. $ modprobe -r snd-bebob snd-fireworks snd-firewire-lib (superuser)
2. $ dkms remove snd-firewire/3.11 --all (superuser)
3. $ rm /usr/src/snd-firewire-3.11 (superuser)
4. $ rm snd-firewire-improve

== Bug repots  ==

I add proc interface to help debug. Please send the output to me with your
experience.

snd-bebob:
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#firmware
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#formation
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#clock
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#meter (if the device has)

snd-fireworks:
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#firmware
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#clock
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#meters

snd-oxfw:
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#formation
 - /proc/asound/cardX/#clock
